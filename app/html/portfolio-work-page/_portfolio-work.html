                MONOSUIT is a New York based independent fashion brand known for its comfortable avant-garde street wear
                since.

                The Monosuit team contacted us because they wanted to transfer their online shop from Ecwid to Shopify.
                Once they selected Shopify as their new platform, they requested that we create a brand new store and
                design a custom website theme to match their specifications. Monosuit's goal was to have an exceptional
                design and robust features that could support their business worldwide.

                        We started the project with a detailed analysis of Monosuit's
                        needs and requirements to understand how to best
                        customize the store for their company.

                    Our team also took responsibility for migrating all the data from the previous Monosuit site to the
                    new Shopify platform. We made sure that the transition was seamless and that all data was preserved
                    and updated.

                    To ensure the smooth functioning of the store with different currencies and languages, our team
                    implemented the necessary changes and customizations for the store. We also integrated a payment
                    gateway to provide a convenient checkout experience for Monosuit customers from around the world.
