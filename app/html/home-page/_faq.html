                            How do you estimate the price for your services?
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            We typically estimate the price for our services based on a variety of factors, such as:
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Scope of work: The first thing that we consider when estimating the price for our services
                            is the scope of work required. This includes the specific tasks or services that the client
                            needs, such as designing a new theme, setting up a store, or optimizing an existing site.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Level of customization: The more customized the work, the higher the price. We 
                            may charge more for complex or highly customized work that requires a lot of development or
                            coding.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Timeframe: Experts may charge different rates depending on how quickly the client needs the
                            work done. Rush projects often come at a higher price.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Value-added services: We also offer additional services such as training, support, or
                            ongoing maintenance. These services are often charged separately and can increase the
                            overall cost of the project.x
